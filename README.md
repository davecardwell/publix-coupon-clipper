[Publix](https://www.publix.com/) is a grocery chain that operates throughout the Southeastern United States. This script uses [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) to automatically clip [digital coupons](https://www.publix.com/savings/coupons/digital-coupons) which can then be applied to your purchases in store if you provide your phone number at checkout.

## Command-line Usage

```sh
npx publix-coupon-clipper [email] [password]
```

If you do not provide your [Publix.com](https://www.publix.com/) email address and password the script will check the `PUBLIX_EMAIL` and `PUBLIX_PASSWORD` environment variables. If either of these are missing, you will be prompted for the value to use.

<details>
<summary>Avoiding the Large Chromium Download</summary>

When running `npx publix-coupon-clipper` the Puppeteer library will download Chromium each time (a >130Mb download as of writing).

To avoid this you can set the `PUPPETEER_DOWNLOAD_PATH` environment variable to reuse the same download each time. For example:

```sh
PUPPETEER_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/tmp/.publix-coupon-clipper-chromium npx publix-coupon-clipper
```

Alternatively you can set the `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` environment variable to `1` and `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to your existing Chrome install (eg. on macOS `'/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome'`).

See the Puppeteer documentation on [environment variables](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#environment-variables) for more, but also note that they only [guarantee support](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/#q-why-doesnt-puppeteer-vxxx-work-with-chromium-vyyy) for their bundled Chromium version.

## Package Usage

`publix-coupon-clipper` can also installed from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/publix-coupon-clipper) and used in your own Node.js script.

```javascript
const { clipCoupons } = require("publix-coupon-clipper");

(async () => {
  const couponCount = await clipCoupons({
    publixEmail: "foobar@example.com",
    publixPassword: "letmein",
  });

  console.log(`Coupons clipped: ${couponCount}`);
})();
```

You can optionally provide your own Puppeteer `browser` instance to use:

```javascript
const { clipCoupons } = require("publix-coupon-clipper");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: false,
  });

  await clipCoupons({
    publixEmail: "foobar@example.com",
    publixPassword: "letmein",
    browser,
  });

  // Donâ€™t forget to dispose of your browser!
  await browser.close();
})();
```

An `EventEmitter` called `events` is also exported which provides `info` messages that are useful for logging progress:

```javascript
const { clipCoupons, events } = require("publix-coupon-clipper");

(async () => {
  events.on("info", (message) => console.log(new Date(), message));

  await clipCoupons({
    publixEmail: "foobar@example.com",
    publixPassword: "letmein",
  });
})();
